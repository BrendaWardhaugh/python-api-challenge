Module 6 challenge

Please see the attached documents in the WeatherPy folders to view the code and resources.

This challenge was to demonstrate the used of Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: "What is the weather like as we approach the equator?" as well as to use Jupyter notebooks, the geoViews Python library, and the Geoapify API and the data collected from the WeatherPy to plan future vacations by searching for specific weather criteria and findng a near by hotel.
